  <h2>My favorite is watching Kdrama and Cdrama, which used to make my day. However, I don't watch as much now due
    to being busy. Kdrama is still the only thing that excites me.</h2>

<p><h2>
      Highlands in Iba Zambales is good because you 
      can experience the youth camp, there are many games and they have a church. Actually, the reason why I went there was because my father was a tourist bus driver and when I didn't have school or when they were going to a far away place, he would take me with him. And since my dad's boss is my uncle, it's fine if I go along when this happens, but of course it can't be always just once.
