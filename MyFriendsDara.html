  <h1>Rouella Mae</h1>

  <p><h2>
    This is my friend Rouella Mae, she has been my friend for 7 years.
    We met when I was in the 9th grade, and since then we have been friends
    and I always went to see them in Sineguelas where they were still living.
    We go to school every 12nn in the afternoon, so i went to them as early as 
    9 am or 10 am because we can't spend a day without being together HAHAHAHAHAHA
    and back to my story that i went to them early and he was just about to clean 
    their house and i helped her but all her wanted to do was just sit HAHAHAHAHA.
    And the two of us also ate together with them and we went to school together 
    and even on the weekend i went to them sometimes to be with him, we developed a
    great friendship and because of that i became comfortable with her and her knows 
    all my secrets  and of course i know her secrets too. I have a lot of trust in her
    because i know her will never criticize me because when we don't like something between
    each other we say it and he never judges me for whatever my flaws are. And until the 10th grade,
    we were in the same class. When he was with me, there wasn't a day that I wasn't happy.
    And until now we are still friends but they have moved house and are in naic so I can't go 
    because i don't know how to travel alone so when i go i will be with our other friends and our 
    bonding is drinking alcohol because the only time we meet is that we make the most of our time 
    together and also because their house is far away.

  <h1>Maui</h1>

  <p><h2>
    This is my friend Maui and he has been my friend for 6 years. Our friendship started when i
   was in the 10th grade and she was our classmate with rouella mae. And our first meeting was funny 
   because what happened was that I had to put a cover on my notebook and i went around to my classmates 
   to ask if they had any extra notebook covers and when I got to his seat I asked him if he had an extra
   notebook cover and he said yes but it was his notebook cover and we and the rest of our classmates laughed 
   because of what he said and since then we have become friends. And I moved seats so I could be next to Rouella,
   because our seats were arranged based on our last names and my seat was a bit far from them so I moved HAHAHAHAHA.
   I love maui because she really makes me feel that we are the same and she always worries about me so my heart is very
   happy because she treats me like her sister because she is the only child, and because every morning the when we go to
   school, every time we go home, we go straight to their house and we also eat there together and after we finish eating,
   we have done our assignments and activities and Rouella just chases after us to go to their house so that we can do our
   work together. I am very happy when they are with me because I am very comfortable with them both. Because when Maui
   notices something in me, he tells me right away. Not a day passed that I couldn't not be with them, so even though we went
   to school in the morning, I still got home at 6pm. And because of the pandemic, our communication with Maui was cut off because
   Rouella and I were blocked on fb. of his girlfriend, we sulked with Maui during those times because we didn't know what we had
   done wrong to block us because before the pandemic we were fine and there was no fight between the three of us. That's how we found 
   out that the girlfriend blocked us because we had communication again this year in August and she apologized to us and we planned to 
    meet again but it didn't work out because my and Rouella's schedule didn't work scene because he is in college as well.

  <h1>Mercil</h1>

  <p><h2>
  This is Mercil, I only met him last year, because he was my co-worker at Black Pink 199 Samgyupsal near here in sm bacoor. 
   When I met mercil, I immediately felt comfortable with him because he was all light and fun to be with and that day he asked for my 
   name on fb and we became friends and that's when our friendship started. Even though I don't know him well, I feel comfortable with 
   him because he is also kind and because he is gay. Mercil was very caring
Sandara
Sandara Sangcajo 
towards me so I fell in love with him. Because when we left 
   our jobs at Black Pink, we met again to look for another job and we ended up at Jollibee and that's where we applied and of course requirements 
   are needed before entering a job, I was just impressed because even though we hadn't been together or known each other for that long, he told me
   that he would help me meet my requirements so that I could enter the job. And in 1 week we adjusted my requirements and that's when I got to know
   him better and I liked him even more because he is caring and kind even with an attitude sometimes HAHAHAHAHA, actually one of the things I like 
   most about him is saying and he really shows what his true character is. And I really miss being with him HAHAHA because he's also busy with work so 
   we don''t see each other very much anymore. But until now we still say hello and support each other.
